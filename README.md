# nvim-config

## Vim support
This config file is written in ```.vim``` and most of the plugins will therefore work in the regular Vim as well. Conquer of Completion is an exception to this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some plugins (like Conquer of Completion) will require additional plugins like pip3, nodejs, npm, etc.) for them to work. A NerdFont will also be nessecary to display certain icons in the editor itself.

## Installed plugins
All the plugins are installed using [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

> [!NOTE]
> Lastly I should mention that I only use neovim on a Windows Subsystem for Linux or shortly [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
You can install this simply in a windows terminal (I personally use PowerShell) by typing 'wsl --install'. I use Ubuntu for the Linux system but any other should work just fine.
