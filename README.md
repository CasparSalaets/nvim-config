# nvim-config

When I started programming in neovim I watched a guide by [NeuralNine](https://github.com/NeuralNine/config-files) on how to setup nvim with a config file. So my config will mostly be based on his' 
This is mainly the reason my config file is written in a '.vim' format rather than '.lua'.

For this config to work it is required to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and some additional packages regarding the autocomplete of python, the programming language I use.
